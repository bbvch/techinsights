### Blog post folder structure

```
blog/
   YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug/
      index.mdx
      images/
         cover.png
         other-image.png
```

- Each blog post should be in its own folder under `blog/` with a name following the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug/`. The date can be the publish date committed with @bbv-blog-admin.
- `index.mdx` is the main content file for your blog post. It should include [frontmatter](#frontmatter-example) at the top with metadata about the post (title, description, authors, date, tags, image).
- The `images/` folder is for any images you want to include in your post. You can reference images in your content using relative paths (e.g., `./images/other-image.png`).

### Frontmatter example

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
description: "Short description for the blog list card" # SEO purpose, used in BlogListPage cards
authors:
  - autherkey  # from blog/authors.yml
date: 2026-01-21 # publish date: use it, if you want to override the date used in the folder name
tags: [tag1, tag2]
image: ./images/cover.png # relative path to the cover image for this post, used in BlogListPage cards and post page header
---
```
